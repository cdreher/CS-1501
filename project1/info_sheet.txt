Does your program run without error?:	For the most part...

If not, what is/are the error(s) and which parts of your program run
correctly?:

-find: runs smoothly, without error
-check: on compile time, after 2 minutes or so, "OutOfMemoryError: GC Overhead Limit" error pops up. Fix this by running "java -Xmx6g PwCheck -check" INSTEAD OF "java PwCheck -check".



Additional comments to the grader:

If you run the -Xmx6g command with -check, it will successfully execute in 40-45 seconds. -find executes in 30-35 seconds. 
In -check, when checking passwords, some passwords may have difficulty (i.e. come up as invalid when valid, dont find 10 matches, give null exception). For the most part, -check executes correctly...
